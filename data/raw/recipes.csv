"705","20 mins","1. For shortbread base: Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Invert bottom of springform pan (to make it easier to slide shortbread base off bottom), then lock on side of pan and line bottom with a round of parchment paper. 2. Pulse hazelnuts with sugar in a food processor until nuts are finely chopped. Add flour, butter, cocoa, and salt and pulse just until a dough forms. 3. Press dough evenly onto bottom of springform pan with your fingers. Prick all over with a fork, then bake until just dry to the touch, about 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer base in pan to a rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes. Remove side of pan and carefully slide out parchment from under shortbread, then reattach side of pan around shortbread base. 4.

Make ganache and glaze cake: Bring cream to a simmer in a small heavy saucepan and remove from heat. Add chocolate and let stand 1 minute, then gently whisk until completely melted and smooth. Transfer ganache to a small bowl and cool, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened but still pourable, about 20 minutes. 7. Run a warm thin knife around inside of springform pan, then remove side. Slide cake off bottom of pan and transfer to a serving plate. Pour ganache onto top of cake and spread, allowing excess ganache to drip down sides.","2 tablespoons hazelnuts, toasted and skins rubbed off; 3 tablespoons sugar; ½ cup all-purpose flour; ¼ cup unsalted butter, softened; 2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder; ⅛ teaspoon salt; 1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin; 3 tablespoons cold water; ½ cup chocolate hazelnut spread such as Nutella; ½ cup mascarpone; 1 ½ cups chilled heavy cream; 2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder; 3 tablespoons sugar; 5 tablespoons heavy cream; 3 ½ ounces fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (not unsweetened), chopped","Chocolate-Glazed Hazelnut Mousse Cake","40 mins","5.0","1","4 hrs 30 mins","https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/134726/chocolate-glazed-hazelnut-mousse-cake/"
